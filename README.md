# DiagnoEase ‚Äì AI-Powered Blood Report Summarization & Health Insight System

## ü©∫ Project Overview

DiagnoEase is an AI-powered mobile application designed to transform raw medical blood test reports (CBC) into simple, layman-friendly summaries. By combining deep learning and natural language processing, it solves a real-world healthcare challenge: helping non-medical individuals understand their health without needing expert interpretation.

This system eliminates the dependency on constant clinical visits by offering instant, AI-generated interpretations of blood reports, empowering users to stay informed about their health ‚Äî anytime, anywhere.

---

## üöÄ Why This Matters

Millions of people receive CBC test reports every year but often fail to grasp the meaning of complex medical terms. DiagnoEase bridges this critical gap by:

- Automatically extracting data from PDF reports.
- Generating human-understandable summaries using fine-tuned transformer models.
- Offering fast, on-the-go results through a mobile app.

This innovation makes preventive healthcare more accessible, especially in rural or under-served areas, and reduces unnecessary hospital follow-ups.

## üìä Dataset

- ~10,000 entries combining real CBC PDF reports (anonymized) collected from students and structured .xlsx datasets from Kaggle & Mendeley.
- Extracted parameters include:
  - Hemoglobin, RBC Count, WBC Count, Platelet Count
  - PCV, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW
  - Differential Leukocyte Counts, MPV, PCT, PDW
- Each report is paired with a manually written summary including diseases users may be prone to highlighting abnormalities in understandable language.
- Data stored and processed via structured Excel files for training and evaluation.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

- **Data Collection**
  - Gathered anonymized medical PDFs and public datasets.
- **Preprocessing**
  - Extracted values via PyMuPDF, structured them into tabular format.
  - Cleaned and tokenized summaries using NLP techniques.
- **Model Training**
  - Fine-tuned transformer models (T5, BART) on report-summary pairs.
  - Evaluated using ROUGE metrics and validation loss.
- **Deployment**
  - Built Flask-based backend API serving the summarization model.
  - Kotlin-based Android app for real-time report upload and feedback.

## üì± How It Works

1. Users upload a CBC PDF report via the Kotlin Android app.
2. The app sends the file to a Flask API for processing.
3. AI model extracts values, summarizes the report in plain English.
4. Summary + risk insights are sent back to the app instantly.

---

## üåê Real-World Impact

- Reduces patient confusion and anxiety over medical reports.
- Minimizes unnecessary clinic visits for basic report interpretation.
- Boosts accessibility to healthcare knowledge in remote regions.
- Enables doctors to focus on more critical diagnostics while patients stay informed.

---

## üî≠ Future Scope

We are actively working to expand DiagnoEase into a full-fledged health monitoring platform:

- Expanding scope to  summarize all other domains reports and not only specifically CBC 
- Deployment of the app on the Google Play Store.
- Intake of user-specific data (age, gender, medical history).
- Visual dashboards to track CBC trends using graphs and plots.
- Integration of a nutritional/diet recommendation system based on test results.
- High-grade user data privacy and end-to-end encryption for security compliance.

## üåê Hosting Flask Backend Online using Ngrok

To allow the Android app to communicate with your locally running Flask API, we use **Ngrok** to expose `localhost:5000` to the internet through a public URL.

---

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. *Activate Python Virtual Environment*

Make sure your environment is activated before running the app:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 2. *Start the Flask App*

Run the backend server:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start your app on:  
`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

> ‚ö† **Keep this terminal open** ‚Äî it needs to stay running.

#### 3. *Install and Authenticate Ngrok*

If you're using Ngrok for the first time on a new machine, get your **AuthToken** from  
[https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) and run:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_AUTHTOKEN>
```

**Example:**

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken 2ofLNa8LyGvp6uEll7ZBvfqT15j_66vu12VsX92Uofsa89hWM
```

#### 4. *Start Ngrok to Tunnel Port 5000*

You can either use a dynamic random domain:

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

Or, if you have reserved a **custom subdomain** (e.g., reliably-vocal-meerkat.ngrok-free.app):

```bash
ngrok http --domain=reliably-vocal-meerkat.ngrok-free.app 5000
```

Ngrok will now generate a public URL like:  
`https://reliably-vocal-meerkat.ngrok-free.app`  
which forwards to your local server on port 5000.

#### 5. *Use This URL in the Android App*

In your Android project (usually in the Retrofit client setup), use the Ngrok-generated URL as your **base URL** so the app can send requests to the Flask server.

### üîÅ Quick Command Summary

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# Run the Flask app
python app.py

# Add ngrok authtoken (one-time)
ngrok config add-authtoken <your_authtoken>

# Open a tunnel (choose one)
ngrok http 5000
# OR
ngrok http --domain=<your_custom_domain> 5000
```
